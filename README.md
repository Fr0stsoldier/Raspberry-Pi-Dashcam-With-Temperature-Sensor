# Raspberry Pi Dashcam W/ Temperature Sensor
Myself and a partner created this project for a Software Interface course. 
The idea was to create a dashcam attached to a display that would be able to read information from Arduino sensors. 
The team decided to use a temperature sensor to display this concept.
